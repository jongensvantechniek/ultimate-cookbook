# [1.6.0](https://github.com/ajgon/opsworks_ruby/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0) (2017-06-03)


### Bug Fixes

* **ubuntu:** proper provisioning for ubuntu 16.04 ([ea5b530](https://github.com/ajgon/opsworks_ruby/commit/ea5b530)), closes [#81](https://github.com/ajgon/opsworks_ruby/issues/81)


### Features

* **webserver:** Specify upgrade method for nginx ([2624d04](https://github.com/ajgon/opsworks_ruby/commit/2624d04))
* **logrotate:** rotate all logs in app/log ([4737b49](https://github.com/ajgon/opsworks_ruby/commit/4737b49))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Support for all legacy distributions has been dropped
off. Currently, only Ubuntu 16.04 and Amazon Linux 2017.03 are
supported.

This cookbook _should_ work on earlier versions (especially on Ubuntu),
PR with fixes to them _will_ be accepted, however the core team won't
include any patches for those distros by they own.

### Performance Improvements

* Added `fasterer` gem to overcommit ([c1ed974](https://github.com/ajgon/opsworks_ruby/commit/c1ed974))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* global: If you were using an `app['environment']` variable (for example to set env to
staging), please update your stack/layer JSONs to `app['global']['environment']`.
* appserver: Unicorn is no longer a default appserver, in favor of Puma. If you have a working
instances which were relying on that, you have to either set `app['appserver']['adapter'] =
'unicorn'` in your stack/layer JSON file, or switch the app server in your application
* webserver: `sites-available` and `sites-enabled` file names format
changed. From this commit, the `*.conf` extension is appended. If you
plan to update your cookbooks on productional environments, don't forget
to remove the old ones, otherwise you will end up with two the same
configurations in different files, which cause `nginx` to fail.

If you start noticing `duplicate upstream` errors, this is probably due
this case.
